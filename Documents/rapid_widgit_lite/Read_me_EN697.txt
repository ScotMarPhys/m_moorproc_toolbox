The Endeavor used a variation of SCS so addded this to possibilities in rapid_widgit_lite
However, accessing new data was rather slow so added a quick and dirty procesing route for last 
5000 seconds of data using "quick_scs" and made new version of widgit rapid_widgit_lite_q.

Whilst making these changes I realised that code coudl be tidied up alot and made more readable
Maybe one day I will do that
