Gridding of velocity data into vertical profiles at 10db.

velocity_grid_adcp.m
Grids adcp data


velocity_grid_nor.m
Grids nortek current meter data from eb1 or wb1 [should also run on wb2 but I haven't done that yet]


The respective _analysis.m programmes are the beginning of analysis to discover methods for interpolation and some analysis.

To run these scripts will require some changes of pathnames. They were originally written on my 
mac mini during the cruise.
