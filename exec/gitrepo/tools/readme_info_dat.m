These times are used in the cutoff of % deployment and recovery periods (to be refined during stage2 process). %% -----------% Very rough guide to using the microcat routines% jym, 21 April 2005%% First run mc_call_2 from stage 1. Remember to insert the appropriate% mooring code and, if you run it for the first time, to create% the appropriate subdirectory (microcat) of the mooring directory.% Then, run microcat_raw2use from stage2.%% -----------% Idiot's guide to loading from the rdb database% jym, 22 April 2005%% Often, one would want to read back in individual files, or% collection of files if one is ambitious. Fundamentally,% this is through the routine rodbload; for authoritative% information, type 'help rodbload'. This routine offers% great flexibility in reading in collections of files% (well, according to the TV advert anyway).%                                                                  % For pedestrians, here is a statement that actually worked% and read in a single file, that of microcat 3227 on% mooring mar1_1_200412_3227. Generalisation should be obvious:% Notice that you must be in the directory where the data file% is located. This certainly can be extended but...%                                                                  % [YY,MM,DD,HH,T,C,P]=rodbload('mar1_1_200412_3227.use','YY,MM,DD,HH,T,C,P');% The variable names should be self-explanatory.%% -----------%
