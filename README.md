### What is this repository for? ###

This repository contains the processing functions used for the processing of the UK-OSNAP mooring data. All these processing functions come originally from the AMOC-RAPID processing developed at NOC (they were located under the rapid/exec/"cruise"/ directory). At this time only the functions used during the last UK-OSNAP cruise (for ADCP, Nortek and microcat processing) were moved in this toolbox. Part of them were adapted/modified by the author.

The idea behind that is to separate the core functions from the processing scripts to be able to better track the changes in the code using version control software as GIT by monitoring the core functions only, and for example being able to share the evolution of the processing code efficiently between SAMS and NOC.

In the future this toolbox aims to gather other functions present like for the BPR, the Rapid widget, etc.... This will allow to keep track and record the changes in the code, and make easier sharing code between researcher inside SAMS but also with other institutes.

Contributions are more than welcome, if one wants to make comments, create a new branch, adding processing functions for other instruments, widgets, etc...
