Matlab tools for working with instrument data from (OSNAP, RAPID) deep water moorings. The functions contained within this repository take data from raw to gridded and merged time series. Utilities for mooring positioning are also included. Based on the RAPID-MOC and RODB toolboxes, developed at IfM Kiel, NOC, and SAMS. 

To start, customise run moor_setup.m to point to the locations of the data (and output files) on your system. Run before processing or call it in your MATLAB startup.m file. 

For documentation,  see Documents/Processing_documents/mooring_processing.pdf
